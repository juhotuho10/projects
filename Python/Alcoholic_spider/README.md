#  Alcoholic Spider
A fun web crawler suggested by a friend that fetches the HTML code from the Alko website I made back in in September 2021

It extracts product data for all alcoholic beverages and 

calculates the alcohol percentage per liter per euro value
The program determines the best cost-to-alcohol ratio drink from Alko

couple of notes:
- The program NEEDS firefox to be installed, because we use the default user firefox profile with the webdrive to access Alko website
- Sadly currently windows only
- The program has to parse a lot of HTML code, so loading it into RAM and running it can be a bit slow, taking about 10-30 minutes.
