###  Alcoholic Spider:

- Created in September 2021
- 
- finally fixed again, YAY
- NOTE 1: The program NEEDS firefox to be installed, because we use the default user firefox profile with the webdrive to access Alko website
- also the way we get the default profile is constrained to windows only
- NOTE 2: The program has to parse a lot of HTML code, so loading it into RAM and running it can be a bit slow, taking about 10-30 minutes.
- A fun web crawler suggested by a friend that fetches the HTML code from the Alko website
- It extracts product data for all alcoholic beverages and calculates the alcohol percentage per liter per euro value
- The program determines the best cost-to-alcohol ratio drink from Alko
