# LLM with RNN 
A Character "LLM" implemented from RNN components as part of a Machine Learning course 

the RNN keeps track of it's own learned internal state and uses that as well as the currenct charater to predict upcoming characters

It's an LLM for character to character prediction, but it could pretty easily be converted into a simple word based LLM
