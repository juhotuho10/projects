### WeatherApp:

- Created in October 2023
- Final project for Programming 3 course
- The project was supposed to be a group assignment, but in reality, I completed it on my own
- It's a convenient weather application with an impressive interactive UI that uses the OpenWeather API

All project documentation can be found in the Documentation folder.

To run the application, open the command prompt and execute:

```mvn package```

and then:

```java -jar target\WeatherApp-1.0.one-jar.jar```

Note: You need to have Java and Maven installed on your system.
