## Sorting algorithms
---
Made in August 2023, mostly because I just wanted to try out Rust and programming with it.
I implemented the algorithms based only on descriptions of how they work, so their performance is not always optimal, but I learned a lot.

You can run the code from the sorting_algo.exe file, and the source code is in src/main.rs
