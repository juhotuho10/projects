# Sorting algorithms
Project where I implemented lot of sorting algorithms from scratch to try out Rust in August 2023

Implemented sorting algos:
- comb_sort
- quick_sort
- merge_sort_deque
- merge_sort
- bucket_sort
- insertion_sort
- shell_sort
- selection_sort
- optimized_bubble_sort
- bubble_sort

can be run with the sorting_algo.exe file, the source code can be found in src/main.rs

If you have rust installed, you can run `cargo run --release` to compile and run the program
