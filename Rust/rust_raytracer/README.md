# Rust raytracer
CPU raytracer made in June 2024 that traces light to render a single sphere

This was the starting point before I started to move everything to the much larger GPU taytracer version of this project

Be sure to see the [Fully featured GPU raytracer](https://github.com/juhotuho10/rust_GPU_raytracing)

If you have rust installed, you can run `cargo run --release` to compile and run the program
