# Client - Server
Haskell implementation of a multiple client - multiple server program, where client requests are handled concurrently by the server 
this is made as a project for the Advanced Functional Programming course 

-clients can subscribe to specific server value changes for notifications, also read and write values to the servers
-servers can read and write to other servers as well as get states from them

there is no user interactivity, but there are test to verify the implementation correctness
